# Muck
Muck is a package for developing Minecraft server plugins with the Lukkit framework using Moonscript.

## Getting Started
Install `muck` from LuaRocks to your system tree, otherwise adding `muck-init` and `muck-build` to your `$PATH`.

## `muck-init`
To start writing a plugin, run `muck-init` in an empty directory.

## `muck-build`
To build and test your plugin, run `muck-build`. This will place a .lkt folder in the target/ directory for deployment.
